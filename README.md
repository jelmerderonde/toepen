# Toepen

Toepen is an implementation of the famous Dutch card game. It supports multiple games and uses websockets to communicate changes between the server and the players. The code is configured to run on Heroku and it runs just fine on a free hobby Dyno.

## Installation
Just run `heroku create` and `git push heroku master` and you're ready to go.

## Roadmap
Right now the Toep-rules are not enforced: the game is basically a table with a deck of cards. In the future rule-enforcement could be added.

## Contributing
